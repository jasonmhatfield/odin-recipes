    <h3>
      The star of this Caesar Salad recipe is the homemade dressing. A delicious
      parmesan-garlic dressing is tossed with crisp lettuce, garlicky croutons,
      and a squeeze of fresh lemon. You'll love that this salad pairs with
      anything from steak to lasagna, or can be topped with grilled chicken for
      an easy meal.

    <p>
      Caesar Salad was created in Tijuana, Mexico by Caesar Cardini, an Italian
      immigrant, in the 1920s. He created this salad using ingredients he had on
      hand and served it tableside. This version is my favorite variation.
